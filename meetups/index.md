We activate regional tech communities at the forefront of computing. Search or see a full listing of our upcoming events and groups by checking out our global ACM Meetup Pro network page here:

In addition, we also have regional groups not in our pro network that can be found here:

If you have a group that's not in our pro network, that you would like to have listed, please reach out by email to [mailto:adconk@staff.acm.org](Andrew Conklin).
