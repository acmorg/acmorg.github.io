We cultivate an ongoing conversation across the globe with organizers of regional tech groups who have technical backgrounds. By mentoring, we are able to provide additional help to organizers who are looking for introductions, creative ideas, facilitating meetings, and thought leadership.

In addition, through our steering committee, we have representation and provide strategic input into the [ACM Practitioners Board](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/boards-and-committees) along with other programs and services aimed for a global audience of designers, coders, scientists, and managers.
