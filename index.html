<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>
ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, is the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society, uniting computing professionals through conferences, publications, special interest groups and local chapters. For over 50 years, ACM has helped computing professionals to be their most creative, connect to peers, and see what’s next, by providing opportunities for life-long learning, career development and professional networking.
</p>
<h2>How we can help you</h2>
<p>
There is no faster way to grow your technical network than to pull people together for a technical event. If you do that more than once, you have a community that becomes invested in you. We have recently worked with problem solvers in NYC, Boston, Pittsburgh, and Washington DC to help set up <a href="/cities">ACM Local Meetups</a>.
</p>
<h2>What we are doing next</h2>
<p>
We are currently reaching out to individuals in Austin, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Raleigh, and Seattle to find who would like to become leaders in their local tech communities. To help lead local events with a remote mentor, contact <a href="mailto:adconk@staff.acm.org">Andrew Conklin (adconk@staff.acm.org)</a> or follow along by joining our list below. <br /><br />
