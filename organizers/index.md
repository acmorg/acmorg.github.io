We cultivate an ongoing conversation across the nation with organizers of local technical events who have technical backgrounds. By organizing, we are able to help industry leaders find, educate, and create awareness with our reputable technical audience.  We also help our technically skilled organizers to establish a new rapport with industry leaders.  Are you already an organizer? Use the [Organizers Guide](guide) for more help.  We provide learned best practices from our current organizers on getting started, the effort involved, building audiences, and how you can benefit.
