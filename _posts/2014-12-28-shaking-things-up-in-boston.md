Today, we have a new meetup group in Boston. They are planning their first pre-launch meet 'n greet, followed up with a bigger event in the Cambridge, MA area.  I've had the pleasure of talking with most of these new teammates over the phone in the past few weeks.  With Harvard, MIT, Boston U, and Northeastern, we know that this area has contributed heavily to the field of Computer Science. We look forward to providing easy discoverability around ACM affiliated tech events.  Welcome to [ACM Boston!](http://meetup.com/acm-boston)
