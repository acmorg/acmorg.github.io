Greetings ACM-ers,  

I'm excited to share an ACM Local milestone with you.  On Jan 20th, ACM Pittsburgh meetup had its first open technical talk.  It was truly a rewarding experience for us, as ACM members were excited to organize a new group together. I had the privilege of extending my experience and learnings as a former Chair of the DC Professional Chapter to get things started.   We assembled a mix of organizers amongst professional ACM members and student ACM chapter members in Pittsburgh and at Carnegie Mellon University. This organizer team is carrying forward with more upcoming events. Here’s some brief stats of this past event.  

Talk:  
“The DARPA Robotics Challenge and Baymax in Disney’s Big Hero 6” by Professor Chris Atkeson

* 4 organizers:  
  Karl Herleman, Brandon Lum, David Zhu, and Naman Bharadwaj  

* 150 people in attendance:  
  65 RSVPs through Meetup, the rest through ACM CMU’s facebook event page.  

* 118 people now in ACM Pittsburgh meetup.  

* Mouser Electronics brought two cameras and a film crew.  Will be posted on Mouser’s and ACM’s   youtube pages eventually.

* We were mentioned on January 29th edition of ACM MemberNet.  

We are also ramping up in other cities:

1. In Boston, we are taking a different approach due to all the pre-existing activity by ACM Members.  Greater Boston Professional Chapter, Agile New England, BostonCHI, and the student chapters in the area are doing interesting events that we will begin to post. We now have two co-organizers in the ACM Boston meetup from the Greater Boston professional chapter.  

2. In New York City, we have an exciting talk being planned around Soft Robotics, as a direct offshoot from the Pittsburgh talk.  We are actively seeking new ACM member organizers who want to help our soon-to-be-published ACM New York City meetup group.  If you know someone who might be interested, they will develop new people connections that overlap with SIGEVO, SIGSIM, and SIGDA.  Its amazing what faster processing, more software frameworks and libraries, and 3-D printing can do to the dynamics between our computing subfields.  

Please reply to [adconk@staff.acm.org](mailto:adconk@staff.acm.org) if you have some ACM member leads in NYC.  

I’m excited about where this project is going and I look forward to seeing our local events in cities being highly visible in those cities, but also across all of ACM and its international reach.

Be Creative, Stay Connected, Keep Inventing.
