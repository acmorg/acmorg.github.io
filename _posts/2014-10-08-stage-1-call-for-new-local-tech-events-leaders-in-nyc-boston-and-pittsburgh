## Stage 1: Call for New local tech events leaders in NYC, Boston, and Pittsburgh

Greetings web slinger, I'm Andrew Conklin, former Chair of the Washington, DC Chapter of ACM. I'm helping ACM launch a new local events initiative in three major cities (Pittsburgh, Boston, NYC). We want to help computer professionals like you to build a personal network of smart technical people in the New York City area.

Through locally organized events, you'll get to know others in your field who can share their work experiences and insight, discuss new research ideas, and provide guidance in finding a satisfying job or launching a new technical venture.

We're also looking for motivated individuals to help launch this program. Contact me at adconk@staff.acm.org if you have:
* A strong interest in accelerating your professional network by helping others,
* Availability to contact people, get to know them, and get them on board, and
* A determination to be involved with great technical events, for technical people and by technical people

We're accepting our first wave of lead organizers by October 15.

We're looking forward to opening up a lot of interesting dialogue between academics, practitioners, and hobbyists in your area. Won't you join us?

Sincerely,
Andrew Conklin
ACM Local Activator
