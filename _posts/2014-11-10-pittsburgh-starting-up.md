Today, I'm very excited to see a new team take form in Pittsburgh.  They are planning their first pre-launch meet 'n greet, followed up with a bigger January event at Carnegie Mellon University.  I've had the pleasure of talking with most of these new teammates over the phone in the past few weeks.  Just as the first A.M. Turing award was given to someone at CMU (Alan J Perlis, 1966), Pittsburgh is about to do another first.  Welcome to [ACM Pittsburgh!](http://meetup.com/acm-pittsburgh)
