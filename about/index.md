ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, is the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society, uniting computing professionals through conferences, publications, and local chapter events. For over 50 years, ACM has helped computing professionals to be their most creative, connect to peers, and see what’s next, by providing opportunities for life-long learning, career development, and professional networking.

## Who can I talk to?

I am [Andrew Conklin](http://conkuer.com/resume), [ACM Local Activator](mailto:adconk@staff.acm.org). I'm working with ACM's Membership and Marketing Teams to bring the Local initiative to several cities.  A little about me:

* former Chair of DC Chapter of ACM
* Started DC Nightowls, a local Washington DC entrepreneurial community of 1700+ self-starters
* Background in computer science from Western Michigan University

## How can we help each other?

There's no faster way to grow your technical network than to pull people together for a technical event.  If you do that more than once, you have a community that knows you.  We are currently interviewing individuals in NYC, Boston, Bay Area California, and Pittsburg to see who would like to become leaders in their local tech community. To help lead local events with a remote mentor, jump on our list below.
