ACM is a long standing, prestigious institution that has played a key role in evolving Computer Science and its computing sub-categories like Data Science and User Experience. Association for Computing Machinery started through social connections between computer scientists in a young field.  Now, nearly 70 years later, we're excited about building a new grassroots framework in a much larger field where academics and practitioners are finding it harder to reach each other.

## Who can I talk to?

I am [Andrew Conklin](http://conkuer.com/resume), [ACM Local Activator](mailto:adconk@staff.acm.org). I'm working with ACM's Membership and Marketing Teams to bring this initiative to several cities.  A little about me:

* former Chair of DC Chapter of ACM
* Started DC Nightowls, a local Washington DC entrepreneurial community of 1700+ self-starters
* Background in computer science from Western Michigan University

## How can we help each other?

There's no faster way to grow your technical network than to pull people together for a technical event.  If you do that more than once, you have a community that knows you.  We are currently interviewing individuals in NYC, Boston, Bay Area California, and Pittsburg to see who would like to become leaders in their local tech community. To help lead local events with a remote mentor, jump on our list below.
