ACM is a long standing, prestigious institution that has played a key role in evolving Computer Science and its computing sub-categories like Data Science (KDD) and User Experience (CHI). Association for Computing Machinery started through social connections between computer scientists in a young field.  Now, nearly 70 years later, we're excited about building a new grassroots framework in a much larger field where the divide is greater between academics and practitioners.

## Who can I talk to?

* Started [DC Nightowls](http://meetup.com/dcnightowls), a local Washington DC entrepreneurial community
* Background in computer science from [Western Michigan University](https://www.cs.wmich.edu/)

## How can we help each other?

We are currently interviewing individuals in NYC, Boston, Bay Area California, and Pittsburg to see who would like to become leaders in their local tech community. To help lead local events with a remote mentor, jump on our list below.
