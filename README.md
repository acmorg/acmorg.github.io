# README

## Getting Started
* Install Ruby 2.5.8 using your favorite Ruby manager (asdf, rbenv, rvm)
* In your terminal, do the following:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

* Commit your code to the repo, push, and then it goes live automatically.

## Roadmap
* TBD

## Backlog
* ACM Chicago page to replace http://chicagoacm.org (early 2000s design, no https)

## Completed
* Added new Mentoring Page.
* Changed Guides page to Organizing Page.
* Eliminated URLs back to intermediate Google Calendar.  Instead, calendar events go right to the meetup group.
* Merged the Organizers page into the Guide page.
* Merged the Cities page into the Meetups page.
